    "changelog": "• Pulled up to nightly 29.10.23 (include stable 4.3.5);\n\n• Complete re-creation of the project. This has improved cleaning, use and convenience;\n\n• Redesign of the settings wizard;\n\n• In the settings wizard, added a section «Apps links» for landscape orientation and adapted it;\n\n• In the initial setup wizard, the first tab had an inactive «Back» button. This means that there is a condition under which she will be available. But physically there is no previous tab. It wasn't logical. Now on the first tab the button will be invisible;\n\n• Reworked interface in the first setup wizard;\n\n• In general, special attention was paid to the interface and decals in it for different locations. I didn't look at all the places, but only what caught my eye. I will improve it in the future;\n\n• Fully custom layout in settings;\n\n• Updated the titles and summary in the settings, and also added some tooltips there;\n\n• Expanded the range of text selection on the application page. I was focusing on what the user might need to highlight and copy. Configured by global value is «details_textIsSelectable» to \"values\\bools.xml\";\n\n• Added attr \"android:autoVerify\" for all deep links. This may help in directing links to Aurora on Android 12 and above. Configured by global value is «appsLinks_verified» in \"values\\bools.xml\";\n\n• Changed the frequency range for background checks for application updates from 1-24 hours to 1-48;\n\n• Fixed bugs known to me;\n\n• Update all localizations;\n\n• Optimization and reduction of code volume due to more competent use of components;\n\n• Even more cleaning of garbage from resources and code;\n\n• Reworked the self-update layout and adjusted the receive Internet data to Crxmson;\n\n• Based on the fact that some users do not want to check for self-updates, I added a switch in the settings. Its turning it on and off respectively turns on and off the verification function;\n\n• Technical: Anonymous account on the author's clone does not work, stable error 502.
