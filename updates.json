    "changelog": " • Pulled up to nightly 28.10.23 (include stable 4.3.5);\n\n • Complete re-creation of the project. This has improved cleaning, use and convenience;\n\n • Redesign of the settings wizard;\n\n • In the settings wizard, added a section «Apps links» for landscape orientation and adapted it;\n\n • In the initial setup wizard, the first tab had an inactive «Back» button. This means that there is a condition under which she will be available. But physically there is no previous tab. It wasn't logical. Now on the first tab the button will be invisible;\n\n • Reworked interface in the first setup wizard;\n\n • In general, special attention was paid to the interface and decals in it for different locations. I didn't look at all the places, but only what caught my eye. I will improve it in the future;\n\n • Fully custom layout in settings;\n\n • Updated the titles and summary in the settings, and also added some tooltips there;\n\n • Expanded the range of text selection on the application page. I was focusing on what the user might need to highlight and copy. Configured by global value is «details_textIsSelectable» to \"values\\bools.xml\";\n\n • Added the <b>android:autoVerify</b> attr for all deep links. This may help in directing links to Aurora on Android 12 and above. Configured by global value is «appsLinks_verified» in \"values\\bools.xml\";\n\n • Fixed bugs known to me;\n\n • Update all localizations;\n\n • Optimization and reduction of code volume due to more competent use of components;\n\n • Even more cleaning of garbage from resources and code;\n\n • Reworked the self-update layout and adjusted the receive Internet data to Crxmson;"
